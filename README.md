# MirrorNeuron

MirrorNeuron is an Elixir/BEAM runtime for orchestrating multi-agent workflows with bounded sandbox execution.

It is built around a simple runtime split:

- BEAM handles orchestration, supervision, message routing, clustering, and persistence
- OpenShell handles isolated execution for `executor` nodes

MirrorNeuron is not trying to be a general-purpose batch scheduler. It is designed for event-driven, message-oriented workflows where logical agents collaborate and only the heavy execution path leaves BEAM.

## Highlights

- small built-in primitive set: `router`, `executor`, `aggregator`, `sensor`
- Redis-backed job state, agent snapshots, and event history
- BEAM cluster support with `libcluster` and `Horde`
- bounded execution capacity through executor leases and pools
- shared OpenShell sandbox reuse per job per runtime node
- terminal-first tooling with:
  - `mirror_neuron`
- example bundles for:
  - local workflows
  - shell and Python execution
  - large fan-out scale tests
  - streaming telemetry and anomaly detection
  - LLM codegen/review loops

## Quickstart

```bash
cd MirrorNeuron
mix deps.get
mix test
mix escript.build

./mirror_neuron validate examples/research_flow
./mirror_neuron run examples/research_flow
./mirror_neuron monitor
```

## Core ideas

### Runtime primitives

MirrorNeuron keeps the built-in runtime small:

- `router`
- `executor`
- `aggregator`
- `sensor`

This keeps the core generic and reusable. Domain-specific agent logic belongs in job bundles or user extensions, not in the runtime kernel.

### Logical workers vs execution leases

MirrorNeuron distinguishes:

- logical workers: cheap BEAM processes that hold workflow state
- execution leases: scarce sandbox capacity used by `executor` nodes

This is the key reason the runtime scales better than “launch one sandbox for every worker immediately.”

### Message-driven workflows

Workflows are defined as graph bundles:

```text
job-folder/
  manifest.json
  payloads/
```

- `manifest.json` defines nodes, edges, entrypoints, and policies
  - `agent_type` selects the runtime primitive
  - `type` selects the behavioral template and defaults to `generic`
- `payloads/` contains code and files needed by worker execution

## Main commands

```bash
./mirror_neuron validate <job-folder>
./mirror_neuron run <job-folder>
./mirror_neuron inspect nodes
./mirror_neuron inspect job <job_id>
./mirror_neuron events <job_id>
./mirror_neuron monitor
```

## Cluster and monitoring

MirrorNeuron supports two-box dev-mode clustering and clustered example harnesses.

- [Cluster Guide](docs/cluster.md)
- [Monitor Guide](docs/monitor.md)
- [Reliability Guide](docs/reliability.md)

## Public API surface

The current public inspection and control APIs are documented here:

- [API Reference](docs/api.md)

These APIs are intended to support:

- terminal monitoring
- future dashboards
- operational scripts
- external integrations

## Current scope

MirrorNeuron already supports:

- local execution
- clustered execution
- Redis-backed persistence
- OpenShell-backed executor isolation
- terminal monitoring

It is still evolving in areas like:

- stronger HA and failover
- richer deferred/sensor semantics
- broader artifact-store integration
- more advanced scheduling and recovery policies
